*how can I help in the development of the game*
`We need graphic designers, translators, developers & above all beta testers. Contact us via the discord link to find out more.
Graphic designers can send some graphics to hydrolien.lili502@gmail.com.
Developers need to read standardFile.java to respect standard of the Formiko projet.
Beta testers only need to play & share there experiment.`

*how to solve errors*

`If the window closes unexpectedly, a fatal error may be detected. This usually has an associated error message (maybe in French.)
Contact support & let them know what you were doing & pass the console error message. (As text or as an image)

If a graphic element seems strange to you, do not hesitate to report it (with a screenshot ideally).

If a text element is displayed in a form similar to "buttonPannel.desc.3" the translation may not be finished.

If an action is not performed correctly an error message will be displayed in the console.

If the game window does not close try the alt f4 command.
If the console is open a Ctrl-c or Ctrl-Shift-c in the console should force the game to close.
If that doesn't change anything, start the task manager & force the java shutdown.
If none of the above solutions have effected shut down your computer, restarting the game will no longer cause you any problems.`
