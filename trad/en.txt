With the command "Main rbt name1 [name2] [name3] [etc]" game's images can be easily cropped (Remove transparent edges).
This should make the game even smoother (no need to display pixels transparent borders when drawing the image).
In addition, the sizes of the insects can be chosen independently of the size of the insect in the image.
