**DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING IN stable.**

You can edit Keys.txt, Options.txt.

You can add resource pack to resourcesPacks folder.
Files in resourcesPacks/ will allways be load first.
If you want to create a images resources pack you can create file that have the same name than stable/images files.
Images can be save in .png or .jpg.

To correct some images bugs you can delete file in temporary.
