//conseil:
conseil.1:Did you find a bug? Report it to the game developer at hydrolien.lili502@gmail.com.
conseil.2:Want to participate in the development of the game? Coder, graphic designer and translator are welcome (hydrolien.lili502@gmail.com).
conseil.3:No longer want to micromanage your ants? Use the 2 automatic modes that are able.
conseil.4:Want to vary the style of play a bit? choose a species you haven't played with yet.
conseil.5:Some species of ant are polymorphic. That is to say that they have workers of variable size in order to be able to carry out quite different tasks.
conseil.6:Do not lay too many eggs at once. Otherwise you will no longer be able to take care of it until it becomes imagos.
conseil.7:Ants go through 4 stages of development: egg, lava, nymph and imago (adult ant).[auto]
conseil.8:The choices you have to make are indicated at the top left of your screen.
conseil.9:Ants do not have an eyelid to moisten their eyes. They must constantly maintain a healthy lifestyle in order to communicate with their antenna and see with their eyes.
conseil.10:The eggs, lava and nymph are not able to clean them on their own. They need help from an imago or they could be infected with a bad bacteria. make sure your brood stays above 50% cleanliness.
conseil.11:The Queen can only lay eggs when she is in the anthill.
conseil.12:The granivorous ants feed exclusively on seeds. To store their food they keeps the seeds in dry rooms of the anthill.
conseil.13:The granivorous ants are not able to Trophalax. To feed the brood they must necessarily have seeds open in stock in the anthill.
conseil.14:The speeds are expressed by insects. The faster the insect, the faster the game will be. The Ant speed corresponds to the standard speed.
conseil.15:Does the game seem too complicated? Choose easy or very easy difficulty.
conseil.16:Does the game seem too easy? So try to win an ultra hard game.
conseil.17:If you prefer to explore the map on your own, check the cloudy option.
conseil.18:Have you ever tried running a custom game with only AIs?
conseil.19:If you look closely at the texture of the grass you might notice that it only contains 3 different blades of herbs.
conseil.20:If there is only one ant to clean or feed on the space where your ant is, it will be automatically selected to be cleaned or fed.[auto]
conseil.21:The game language is automatically that of your computer, but you can change it in the Options.[auto]
conseil.22:Some species of ants are polycalic. That is to say that a queen from an anthill A, will lay new ants in her anthill B &amp; the ants A and B will continue to help each other as if she were only one large anthill. On a large map it is useful to lay queen and male eggs which can found new allied anthills at the other end of the map.[auto]

//tuto :
tuto.0:Welcome to Formiko young ant![auto]
tuto.1:Let's learn the basics of this game together so you can have fun.[auto]
tuto.2:Our queen is hungry, let's move it one square to the right so that she can hunt this prey.[auto]
tuto.3:to move an ant you must right click on the square you want to go.[auto]
tuto.4:well ! Now let's eat it![auto]
tuto.5:to kill an insect click on the button "Hunt the insect on the box" located at the bottom of your screen.[auto]
tuto.6:our queen ant succeeded in killing the insect but she did not have enough action to eat it.[auto]
tuto.7:but don't worry, a dead insect won't get very far![auto]
tuto.8:use the "Hunt the insect on the square" button again to eat the insect.[auto]
tuto.9:great you now know how to hunt.[auto]
tuto.10:now it is necessary to ensure the prosperity of the anthill.[auto]
tuto.11:return to the anthill. (right click on the square you want to go to.)[auto]
tuto.12:lay an egg with the "Lay" button at the bottom of your screen.[auto]
tuto.13:the egg is laid. Now you have to take care of it, otherwise it will never reach adulthood.[auto]
tuto.14:let's wait for him to grow up.[auto]
tuto.15:wait for a turn by clicking on the "Skip the turn" button at the bottom of your screen.[auto]
tuto.16:Our egg has grown! It is now a larva![auto]
tuto.17:The larvae need frequent cleaning to avoid dying from disease.[auto]
tuto.18:Clean the larva by clicking on the "Clean" button located at the bottom of your screen.[auto]
tuto.19:Our larva is clean. Let’s wait for it to move up to the next level by passing the turn with the associated button at the bottom of your screen.[auto]
tuto.20:The larva has evolved, it is now a nymph. The nymphs, like the larvae, need to be cleaned and fed.[auto]
tuto.21:To feed the brood (the eggs, larvae and pupae), the ants regurgitate food from their "social stomach". This is called trophallaxis.[auto]
tuto.22:feed the larva with the "Trophallaxis" button at the bottom of your screen.[auto]
tuto.23:The nymph is full! Let's wait a little longer for her to grow up. (click on the "Skip the tour" button at the bottom of your screen.)[auto]
tuto.24:The ant has finally reached the adult stage (imago)! She can now perform actions like the queen.[auto]
tuto.25:Other insects will appear over time. Let's send the queen to kill 1 by clicking on the "auto-hunt" button.[auto]
tuto.26:Automatic hunting allows you to let your ants hunt independently.[auto]
tuto.27:There is also an automatic nanny mode. Leave the queen in the anthill with this mode activated and recommended when there are eggs, larvae or nymphs in the anthill.[auto]
tuto.28:Our species is not granivorous (does not eat seed). However, some neighboring anthills could collect the seeds to eat them.[auto]
tuto.29:The worker we have spawned can perform the same actions as the queen, except lay.[auto]
tuto.30:Workers are even more efficient on certain tasks (it costs them less actions to perform them). Our worker hunts more easily than the queen.[auto]
tuto.31:Let's give our worker a task to complete so that the round ends. (click on one of the buttons at the bottom of your screen, several times if necessary.)[auto]
tuto.32:It was the last round of this tutorial, if you have any doubts you can redo this tutorial.[auto]
tuto.33:Otherwise the button descriptions are displayed when you hover over them, ditto for the boxes on the map. Information about the selected ant is on the right of your screen.[auto]
tuto.34:If despite this you do not find what you need you can seek advice on the game's official discord server: http://discord.gg/vqvfGzf[auto]
tuto.35:To win a game on time you must have a higher score than AI and other players.[auto]
tuto.36:Your score depends on your number of ants, (adult ants give a better score), as well as the difficulty of the game and the speed of the game.[auto]
tuto.37:To restart a game, you have to quit the game and restart it, I'll take care of quitting the game, it's up to you to restart it.[auto]
